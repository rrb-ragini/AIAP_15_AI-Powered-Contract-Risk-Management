This ensures that each party is responsible for claims resulting from their own failures, which is a standard and fair allocation of risk within the context of a single-party indemnity clause. The absence of a reciprocal clause for the Client's breaches might make the *overall contract* unbalanced from a holistic perspective, but it does not render *this specific clause* unbalanced in its defined scope.

This standard is subjective and less rigorous than 'industry standard,' 'best practices,' or compliance with specific regulatory frameworks. This subjectivity introduces ambiguity and potential for dispute, giving the Vendor significant leeway in determining the level of protection, which imbalances the clause in the Vendor's favor. Given the critical importance of data security and the severe consequences of a breach, this ambiguity poses a high risk to the Client.
