Furthermore, the clause lacks any mechanism for managing changes to the scope of services, which is a critical omission for any ongoing service agreement. This absence opens NUIT to significant commercial and operational exposure, including potential scope creep where additional services are implicitly expected without formal agreement or compensation, leading to unbudgeted costs and resource strain. Disputes regarding the scope of work, delays in service delivery due to lack of customer cooperation, and challenges in modifying service parameters without a clear process are significant enforceability risks.

Should a party fail to provide timely notice of non-renewal, they face an unwanted extension of the agreement, leading to unanticipated financial obligations and continued contractual commitment. While the clause itself is enforceable regarding its automatic renewal, the lack of an explicit, self-contained notice period for non-renewal within this provision introduces ambiguity and elevates the risk of inadvertent renewal.

NUIT shall consult with the customer regarding such requirements.", "justification": "This clause is correctly classified as a 'Scope of Services' as it comprehensively details the IT services NUIT provides, including specifics for workstations, mobile devices, printers, and various support functions, alongside an explicit 'Out of Scope' section. While beneficial for clarity, the clause demonstrates a significant imbalance of obligations, primarily favoring NUIT, which elevates its risk profile to moderate. Many of NUIT's stated responsibilities are conditioned on subjective criteria or NUIT's sole discretion, such as 'subject to security approval,' 'if operationally necessary,' and 'subject to availability.' These conditions introduce ambiguity and provide NUIT with considerable latitude to limit its performance, potentially leading to disputes over service provision and creating commercial exposure for customers reliant on these services. Furthermore, the 'Computer Support Policies' unilaterally impose strict age-based limitations on support, including a 'Best Effort' period capped at one hour for 4-5 year old machines and 'Out of Support' for devices 5 years or older. This policy effectively transfers the financial and operational burden of timely hardware refresh to the customer, irrespective of their specific needs or budget cycles. Similarly, the process for 'New Technology' adoption grants NUIT significant control over whether new solutions will be supported, potentially hindering customer innovation. The clause's overall structure, with extensive disclaimers and limitations on NUIT's part without clear reciprocal obligations or mechanisms for customer redress, contributes to its imbalance. The reconciled risk score of 5.5 reflects that while the clause provides a clear framework for services, the numerous qualifications, limitations of liability, and unilateral support policies create material operational and financial risks for the customer, warranting a position at the higher end of the moderate risk spectrum.", "confidence": 0.9}, {"clause_id": 6, "clause_text": "The following list contains the customer\u2019s responsibilities related to their use of this service: General \u2022 Submit requests for services to the IT Support Center (by email, phone, or self-service ticket entry) \u2022 Submit notification of service interruptions or reductions to the IT Support Center \u2022 Provide funding for the purchase of any equipment covered by this SLA \u2022 Provide a list of the devices and their serial numbers for each device covered by this SLA: Initial list will be provided from Kace export o Updates and changes to support environment will be managed in Kace, or its replacement for asset management \u2022 Notify NUIT of devices to be added to the SLA throughout the year through the new computer request form Workstations \u2022 Arrange to refresh workstations within four years of purchase \u2022 Provide funding for the refresh purchase Printers \u2022 Purchase a service warranty for each University owned printer that includes break-fix and full replacement", "golden_clause_detected": true, "golden_clause_type": "Scope of Services", "final_risk_score": 5.0, "risk_level": "Moderate", "business_risk_if_ignored": "If this clause remains uncorrected, the customer faces significant financial exposure due to the explicit obligations to fund equipment purchases, workstation refreshes, and printer warranties without clear reciprocal commitments or service levels from the provider.

The primary risk identified is the inherent imbalance of obligations, as the clause exclusively details the customer's duties without corresponding reciprocal obligations or service level commitments from the provider. While the customer's responsibilities themselves are clearly articulated, the absence of an accompanying framework for the provider's performance or consequences for non-compliance creates a moderate legal and commercial risk. The customer is obligated to perform various actions, including significant financial outlays for equipment, refreshes, and warranties, without clear assurance or remedies concerning the service provider's delivery. This one-sidedness can lead to potential disputes regarding the conditions for service provision, leaving the customer vulnerable to assuming costs and responsibilities without clear reciprocal value. The reconciled risk score of 5.0 reflects this moderate exposure, acknowledging that while the clause is clear about what the customer must do, the imbalance creates an enforceability weakness in terms of overall contractual fairness and potential for commercial disputes if provider performance is not addressed adequately in other sections of the agreement.

The primary enforceability risk stems from the ambiguous definition of 'support activity outside of the scope of this agreement' and the complete lack of definition for 'standard service rate'. Without these essential parameters, the Customer cannot ascertain the true cost implications of such services, leading to potential disputes over what activities are chargeable and at what rate. The clause is significantly imbalanced as it imposes various additional charges on the Customer without corresponding clarity or reciprocal obligations, focusing entirely on the provider's ability to bill extra. This imbalance, combined with the material ambiguity, creates significant commercial exposure for the Customer in the form of unpredictable and potentially substantial cost increases for services that may be deemed 'out-of-scope' or performed during non-standard hours, thereby justifying a moderate-to-high risk score due to its potential for conflict and unbudgeted expenditure.", "confidence": 0.9}, {"clause_id": 8, "clause_text": "Support tickets, pertaining to service incidents (break-fix) and requests, should be submitted via the NUIT Service Desk and include the following information: \u2022 Customer contact information including: name, phone number, email address \u2022 Brief description of the service issue \u2022 Priority level of the incident or request The Service Desk staff will provide first level support to resolve the issue.

These elements directly align with the characteristics of a 'Service Levels' clause. The primary enforceability risk stems from the significant imbalance of obligations: while the customer is explicitly required to provide detailed information and a priority level for incidents, the provider's corresponding performance commitments for resolution are notably absent. The clause specifies operational hours and a 'next business day' response for voicemails, but it lacks specific, measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for incident response and resolution times, particularly those linked to the customer's stated 'Priority level'. This creates substantial commercial exposure, as the customer has limited contractual recourse or defined expectations if support is delayed or ineffective, potentially leading to disputes over service quality rather than clear accountability. The clause's current phrasing uses 'will' for provider actions, which is descriptive, rather than 'shall', which denotes an obligation. This ambiguity regarding the binding nature of the provider's actions, coupled with the absence of quantifiable service targets and any stated remedies for failure to meet implicit or explicit commitments, results in a moderate risk score of 6.5.

Such phrasing does not establish a firm contractual obligation, rendering the service level commitments non-binding. More critically, the clause completely omits any mention of remedies, service credits, or other consequences for the service provider's failure to meet these stated targets. This absence means the service recipient has no contractual mechanism to enforce the service levels or to seek redress for non-performance.

This absence of a clear, enforceable commitment creates a profound imbalance of obligations, heavily favoring the service provider. Furthermore, the clause entirely omits any provisions for remedies, service credits, or other specified consequences for failure to meet even these aspirational targets. This lack of any mechanism to address underperformance exacerbates the enforceability issue, leaving the aggrieved party without a clear contractual basis to claim breach or seek recourse for inadequate service.

The phrasing 'will perform... and present options to review and determine appropriate steps' is inherently vague, failing to clearly define NUIT's binding obligation to resolve the breach or the Client's authority in approving and mandating specific remedial actions. The term 'could include' renders the suggested mitigation steps illustrative rather than mandatory components of a resolution plan. Crucially, the clause lacks defined timeframes for completing the root cause analysis, presenting a plan, or implementing solutions, which allows for potential delays. Moreover, the absence of any explicit commitment for NUIT to actually implement agreed-upon steps, or any specific remedies or penalties for an 'ongoing service level breach,' leaves the Client commercially exposed. This imbalance places the burden of continued service degradation on the Client without guaranteed and timely resolution, as NUIT's obligation is largely limited to analysis and proposing options, rather than compelling the breach's cessation.

This creates an imbalance of obligations where NUIT dictates resource allocation, potentially at the client's commercial detriment. Commercial exposure arises because a client's services, even if deemed critical to their operations, might consistently fall into lower priority tiers according to NUIT's internal interpretation, leading to service degradation or delays without agreed-upon remedies or service credits. While the criteria themselves provide a framework, the subjective interpretation of terms like 'High impact' or 'Time sensitive' by NUIT without a mutual definition process can lead to ambiguity in application and potential disputes over actual service performance.

The requirement for the customer to obtain all assets, specifically data, on or before the date of termination clearly places the responsibility for data retrieval on the customer. While this necessitates careful operational planning by the customer to avoid data loss, the clause itself is clear and enforceable in allocating this obligation. There is no inherent imbalance in the obligations as the termination right is mutual, and the data retrieval responsibility aligns with standard practices for customer-owned data in a service context.
